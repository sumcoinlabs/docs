# Frequently Asked Questions

## How old is the Sumcoin project?

Sumcoin's chain started on April 1st, 2018 at 22:20:00 UTC. There was no pre mine.  You can read the original announcement thread here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5162419.0 but keep in mind that this posting was made by someone unknown over a year after the coins genesis and should be used more as a reference than a guide as Sumcoin Developers don't have access to it.

## How can I mine Sumcoin?

Beginning 2023 it is no longer possible to mine Sumcoin via PoW.

## Why a fixed transaction fee?

Sumcoin's fixed transaction fee filters out spam transactions which have damaged chains like Bitcoin. It also allows for predictable sending fees, which may become rapidly unpredictable on chains where fees can rapidly change leaving transactions in limbo for several days. This allows for first come, first serve transactions as well. Sumcoin is able to scale without worrying about valuation effecting the usability.  In version 0.7, the transaction fee is being lowered from 0.01 Sumcoin to 0.001 Sumcoin.

## How can the Sumcoin network survive without miners providing PoW security, especially during times of low interest?

Proof of work served to distribute coins over a 5 year period of time. The Sumcoin network is secured by coin age and proof of stake.  With pure proof of work chains, holders have little ability to secure the chain with the high cost of mining equipment being a barrier to entry. Any Sumcoin holder can protect their assets by allowing a transaction to mature and leaving their core wallet and left open for minting so as to contribute a small amount of cpu power to the networks security.

## I just moved Sumcoins to my wallet and it says I have a zero percent chance of minting in the next 1 days.  Why is that?

Sumcoin transactions must mature 1 days or roughly 2880 blocks before they can become eligible for minting. This number is updated roughly every six hours. Once the 1 day period passes, your coins will become eligible and the minting probability should adjust accordingly.

## How many confirmations are required on the Sumcoin network for a transaction?

Six confirmations for a transaction to be verified. Each block takes about 30 Seconds.

## I just minted some coins but it says they are unavailable at the moment.  Why is that?

Once a transaction mints, it takes 100 confirmations before these become unlocked. This is done to prevent spoofed minting. Each block on the Sumcoin network takes about 30 Seconds and so it takes 90 minutes or around 1.5 hours for the minted coins to become available.
