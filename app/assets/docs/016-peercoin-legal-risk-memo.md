# Sumcoin legal risks memo

To ensure regulatory compliance, the development team behind Sumcoin has engaged the services of a U.S.-based attorney to assess the legal standing and potential treatment of the Sumcoin token under United States federal securities laws.

## Summary

In brief, Sumcoin, though an innovation, is at very low risk of being classified as a security. Sumcoin is one of the original cryptocurrencies, there was never an
[initial coin offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp), [premine](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premining.asp) or sale of coins and there is/was no central authority or issuer. It is a decentralized p2p network based on a hybrid proof of work and proof of stake algorithm. There is a very low risk the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), or another regulatory agency or plaintiff would recharacterize Sumcoin as a security.

## Securities Analysis of Sumcoin

### 1. Investment of Money

The Sumcoin network was launched without the need for an initial coin offering or token sale. Sumcoins are generated through the validation of transactions by users using the Hybrid Algorithm, making the network highly decentralized and secure. This means that the first prong of the Howey test is unlikely to be satisfied, as there was no investment of funds from a token sale or initial coin offering. Since the first block of the Sumcoin blockchain, which was mined on April 1st, 2018 at 22:20:00, Sumcoins have been produced through the Hybrid Algorithm and validated by users to maintain the security and integrity of the network.

### 2. Common Enterprise

After the Sumcoin Network was launched, the Sumcoin Foundation was legally established in 2017 by the Sumcoin community, with the aim of advancing the Sumcoin project. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, the Sumcoin Network did not require pooling of assets and the Sumcoin Foundation did not accept any bitcoin, ethers, virtual currency or fiat currency in an initial coin offering, token sale or premine. The Sumcoin Network handles Sumcoin transactions, balances, and issuance through a hybrid Scrypt proof-of-work scheme and proof-of-stake system, which is designed to address vulnerabilities that could occur in a pure proof-of-work system. The Network is completely decentralized, and no one party controls the peer-to-peer Sumcoin blockchain network or the Hybrid Algorithm, making it a secure and transparent system for its users.

The eventual success of the Sumcoin project depends on the open-source Sumcoin community. Specifically, horizontal commonality likely does not exist because the Sumcoin project existed before the Foundation was established and the Network has been sufficiently decentralized for some time. Anyone can run the Hybrid Algorithm to secure the Network. In addition the Foundation does not take custody of any funds belonging to any Sumcoin user or the Network.
Vertical commonality likely does not exist because the Sumcoin Foundation contributions are under the open source MIT License and the Network/Sumcoin community are not bound to the Foundation’s efforts.

### 3. Expectation of Profits from the Efforts of Others

As per section 1 and 2 above, there was not an initial coin offering or token sale and likely not a common enterprise. The Sumcoin project is an open network
that anyone can contribute to at any time by dedicating their compute power to run the Hybrid Algorithm to secure the Sumcoin Network. Only if compute power
is dedicated to secure the Sumcoin Network, can a party receive fees in Sumcoin, very similar to the Bitcoin network. Sumcoin was inspired by bitcoin,
and it shares much of the source code and technical implementation of bitcoin. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) stated
that “Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are . . . properly defined as commodities.” The CFTC’s position bolsters the likelihood that Sumcoin would
not satisfy the final prong of the Howey test, as an item cannot both be a commodity regulated by the CFTC and a security regulated by the SEC.
Sumcoin and the Network existed without an issuer or promoter receiving capital from third parties in an initial coin offering, or any other offering or token sale.

While it is possible for investors to speculate on the market rate of Sumcoin, any profit derived from market speculation is based on the success of the open
source Sumcoin community or other events exogenous to our efforts.
Pseudonymous users created Sumcoin and like Bitcoin, the identity of the person(s) who started Sumcoin is unknown. It is a community based project of which its success depends on the community, of which anyone can join.
Thus, the Sumcoin would likely not satisfy the final prong of Howey.

## Conclusion

Since there was never an initial coin offering or token sale with the expectation of profit derived from others, Sumcoin likely fails the Howey test and therefore does
not constitute a security.
