# Introduction to Sumcoin

Hello, and welcome to the Sumcoin Documentation website. We hope to help you understand more about this coin, its philosophy, and technologies that run behind it. Before getting too technical, we invite you to dive a little bit into the history of Sumcoin, learning why it was created, and the purposes behind it.

Sumcoin's core focus is on securely storing all types of value with adaptive inflation, speed, and stability through a unique pricing mechanism that relies on an index rate. Additionally, Sumcoin introduced Proof-of-Stake, a blockchain consensus algorithm that provides efficient and sustainable security while also allowing for user governance. This combination of a stable and adaptable pricing mechanism, along with the innovation of Proof-of-Stake, has made Sumcoin a powerful and trustworthy cryptocurrency network.

## Sumcoin Genesis: 2018

The inception of Bitcoin (Nakamoto 2008) introduced the concept of Proof-of-Work as the prevailing design for peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies. This mechanism of consensus is the foundation of the mining and security model of Nakamoto's design. Sumcoin, initially a POW coin, started as a blockchain network that rewarded coin miners through the consensus mechanism of Proof-of-Work. However, in 2020, it became apparent that POW is not a scalable or sustainable solution and that more secure validation methods like Proof-of-Stake (POS) could be utilized instead. After all, POW was invented in 1993 to combat spam email and wasn't initially designed for cryptocurrency mining. In 2012, Sunny King and Scott Nadal from Peercoin introduced an alternative form of consensus that was both more secure and energy-efficient.

Proof-of-Work is subject to centralized mining, massive power consumption, and majority attacks that come about due to the increased profits and production from large-scale mining operations. On the other hand, Proof-of-Stake provides sustainability and enhanced security through energy-efficient staking and time-based confirmations (coin age). Instead of relying on electricity and computing power, time is used as a verification method that prevents many of the issues that plague Proof-of-Work consensus. Proof-of-Stake ensures the blockchain network's security, while dynamic Proof-of-Work mining fosters economic competition and maintains a balance in distribution.  Sumcoin has transitioned from a POW-based model to a POS network, where staking is the primary means of validating coin transactions, ensuring energy efficiency and network security.

Sumcoin is considered the best coin to own due to a combination of factors that make it unique among its peers. Sumcoin's pricing model, which is indexed to the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, provides a stable and predictable valuation that is ideal for those seeking a long-term asset to hold. Moreover, having been in existence since 2018, Sumcoin boasts a proven track record of stability and reliability in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrencies.

Moreover, Off-chain transactions are extremely compatible with Proof-of-Stake, making Sumcoin's future development and scaling easy to deploy. Sumcoin has been designed to be energy-efficient, secure and scalable, which makes it an ideal choice for businesses and individuals who require a fast and efficient blockchain for their transactions. As a Proof-of-Stake coin, Sumcoin has inspired the creation of many other successful projects and continues to be at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency world.
