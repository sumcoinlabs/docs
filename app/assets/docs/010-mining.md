# Mining

>Sumcoin has used both the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake algorithms. The PoW algorithm was used to spread the distribution of new coins. 100% of all Sumcoins were created with PoW from 2018 until 2023. Proof-of-Stake is now used to secure the network: The chain with longest PoS coin age wins in case of a blockchain split-up.

Sumcoin used the hashcash double iterated Sha256d algorithm for [Proof-of-Work mining](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work).

## Sumcoin POW mining is now deprecated

* Sumcoin blocks are now soley validated via Proof of Stake (POS) however you can still find infomation where data is tracked such as the link(s) below.

## Sumcoin Mining Pools

* [MiningPoolStats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/sumcoin)


## Mining Confirmations

Once a block has been mined (was mined), 100 blocks had to be passed for the mining to be confirmed. This was roughly 1.5 hours of time.
